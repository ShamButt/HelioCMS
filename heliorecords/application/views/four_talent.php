                <p><em>[L to R: Deffie, Oshi, Medasin, Taja]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a sunny day in Austin, Texas, halfway through the city-wide music festival, when I cruise up north to the suburbs, away from the desperate mixtape throwers and showcase shuffles. I’m meeting with some of the strongest, most buzzworthy and talented acts on SoundCloud, although don’t call them “SoundCloud producers” because it’s 2016 and you shouldn’t box people into a category; instead, they’re producers, DJs, singers,&nbsp;artists who use the massive platform as an attempt to&nbsp;stand out amongst the competition, to spread their sound to the masses, one repost and one heart at a time.</p>
<p>When I arrive at their Airbnb&nbsp;mansion, Dallas-based producer&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialmedasin" target="_blank">Medasin</a> greets me at the door. He’s covered in tattoos and never stops smoking cigarettes. He escorts me to the backyard, where a handful of people are conversing by the pool. 17-year-old London producer <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oshi" target="_blank">Oshi</a>&nbsp;lounges in a beach chair, his curly hair everywhere. 20-year-old L.A. producer <a href="https://soundcloud.com/deffiedeff" target="_blank">Deffie</a> arrives in the backyard halfway through the interview to voice some knowledge while DJ/vocalist <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tajabarber" target="_blank">Taja</a> relaxes by the table, chiming in here and there, petting her dog and enjoying&nbsp;the joint being passed around. All four of these artists will be playing a few hours after our interview, back in the heart of Austin, at a showcase hosted by Brownies &amp; Lemonade, including acts like Louis the Child, Dave Luxe, Y2K, and more.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="soundcloud/player.html"></iframe>
<p>This isn’t the first time that all of these artists have met, but it’s not often that they interact in person. When I first ask them how they met, they say SoundCloud, and with enough surfing through the site, it’s easy to see that this grouping all ties into the online collective <a href="https://soundcloud.com/noirsound" target="_blank">Film Noir: Sound</a>, which was founded by KRS, BNJMN, and Oshi. Medasin says how he first got in contact with KRS, “and then&nbsp;Deffie messaged us, then it just popped off, then we got a show, and we all met.” Performing together back in <a href="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11822537_1515102898728325_3133039647693616351_n.png?oh=87b3c605baad558b9d779eabff258891&amp;oe=57787FE9" target="_blank">August in DC</a>, the artists have since met up in Los Angeles and now, here, in Texas.</p>
<p>To provide a bit more background, Medasin is perhaps best known for his collaborative EP with Masego titled <a href="https://soundcloud.com/noirsound/sets/pinkpoloep" target="_blank"><em>The Pink Polo</em></a> EP. He’s worked with Josh Pan, he’s remixed Flume, and he’s steadily releasing strong instrumentals.&nbsp;Oshi, meanwhile,&nbsp;has been releases heat on his own terms, recently&nbsp;stepping it to the next level when Lorde shouted out his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oshi/kali-uchi" target="_blank">Kali Uchis reworking</a>. For&nbsp;Deffie, his new song with Alexander Lewis is taking off and he also just collaborated on a Soulection White Label track with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/romderful" target="_blank">ROM</a> (the two released an EP called <em>Entropy</em> last year). Lastly,&nbsp;Taja is the only female in the group that I interview, as well as the only non-producer. The singer/DJ is cool and quiet, her SoundCloud full of smooth singles and high energy mixes. She&nbsp;later rocks a Rostrum Records hoodie during her set, perhaps hinting at label ties.</p>
<p>The backyard booms with young talent. The whole crew reps the X on their hands, the underage marker for “No booze”, meaning that they came to SXSW for a reason: to grow.&nbsp;Inside, after the interview, I ask Oshi if he’s the youngest person in the house, and he says second youngest, pointing to a kid in the kitchen who remains quiet. “He’s only 14,” Oshi says. I wasn’t introduced and&nbsp;I wasn’t aware of what he looked like at the time, but&nbsp;Oshi had actually pointed to 18-year-old trap producer <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cavalierbeats" target="_blank">Cavalier</a>. A subtle troll I had to find out on my own.</p>
<p><a href="images/oshimed.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1301"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1301" src="FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/oshimed-225x300.jpg" alt="oshimed" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oshimed-225x300.jpg 225w, http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oshimed.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"></a></p>
<p>Being as it is halfway through the music festivities of SXW, I ask them how their week has been going so far.</p>
<p>“Josh Pan had a show,” Medasin says. “He’s a nut. Me, Deffie, Oshi, and Cavalier got on stage at the Nest HQ showcase with Josh and played some shit.”</p>
<p>Other than Josh Pan, all of the aforementioned artists will be performing tonight, for their own showcase, one that received thousands of RSVPs from curious heads, loyal fans, and press contacts. A great deal of attention for a tiny outdoor stage. They’re looking at the weather forecast, which calls for thunderstorms.&nbsp;“My hair looks cool in the rain,” Oshi says, “but that’s about it.”</p>
<p>I ask Medasin and Oshi about the “Opus”, the Keith Ape “It G Ma” Remix that Josh Pan crafted, a fourteen minute long track alongside a plethora of producers and rappers alike. I ask them which parts they helped with.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="./FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/player(1).html"></iframe>
<p>“We kinda purposely didn’t tell anyone just to troll,” Medasin says. “A lot of people say Oshi did my part. Long story short, I did the Waka Flocka part. Not with the guitar, that’s X&amp;G. Oshi had a section with Dumbfounded, but it got scrapped.” Medasin tells me that the song between Misogi and Oshi titled “Beowolf”, a song that dropped almost a year ago, was used for the Opus, as they took the beat and added an cappella over it.</p>
<p>“We just passed around the project,” Medasin continues, with Oshi telling me the song took “months, months.”</p>
<p>“We probably finished it in a month or two,” Medadsin adds, “but it didn’t get released until six months later. We gotta do more stuff like that, more opuses, because no one does shit like that. It’s like a 20 minute beat with all kinds of weird shit.”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna keep it low key,” Oshi says, ”actually it was posted on Twitter, but anyway, this guy<a href="https://soundcloud.com/octbr" target="_blank">octbr</a>, he’s fucking sick, he’s amazing. He posted a tweet like let’s do a super collab and he didn’t really expect to get as many people as he did, but there’s like 30 people and they’re all like really big, and he’s pretty happy [laughs].”</p>
<p><a href="images/7_0.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1302"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1302" src="FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/7_0-200x300.png" alt="7_0" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/7_0-200x300.png 200w, http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/7_0.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></a></p>
<p>Oshi tells me that after SXSW, he’s making an indefinite move to L.A. He&nbsp;tells me that he lives outside of downtown London, in the “urban, rural, ghetto” area, and that the transition to L.A. will be a big change.&nbsp;I ask them all about their plans down the road.</p>
<p>“We all individually have cool things going on,” Medasin says. “For the most part, just keep putting out music. I know Oshi’s got some projects coming. I might. For the most part, just music. Music keeps you relevant. Being relevant gets you shows. That’s the whole path.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a west coast tour in the works,” Deffie tells me. “With ROM.”</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="./FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/player(2).html"></iframe>
<p>“I always announce projects and then I never get around to doing them,” Oshi laughs. “This might be another one of the things I’m not doing, but I’m holding out for some inspiration for it.”</p>
<p>“It’s called <em>A Thing</em>,” Medasin adds.</p>
<p>“<em>A Thing By Oshi,</em>” Oshi says.&nbsp;He tells me that he released the lead single, but that he hasn’t made strides to release the proper project. “I fucking shot myself in the foot. I threw myself under the bus. I bit the hand that fed me.”</p>
<p>Medasin tells me that he has a potential collaboration in the works. “Josh Pan and me and X&amp;G and possibly Graves. We have a little group thing, we don’t know what it’s officially called yet, but we’ve done stuff under the name Afterlife. We’re working on a project. I know an Oshi/Medasin has to happen like soon as fuck. That’s overdue.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, what’s going on with that?” Deffie asks.</p>
<p>“I haven’t had a Medasin/Oshi,” Oshi says, “I haven’t had a Deffie/Oshi. Fuckin’ a.”</p>
<p><a href="images/10_0.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1303"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1303" src="FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/10_0-300x200.png" alt="10_0" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10_0-300x200.png 300w, http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10_0.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Medasin explains the concept of back-to-back (B2B) for me, saying how Oshi has a 45 minute set and he has a 45 minute set, but instead, Oshi will play for 30 minutes, they will go back and forth, track for track, for 30 minutes, and the final 30 minutes will be done by Medasin. Although it’s a new concept for me, it’s a very common and popular technique for DJs.</p>
<p>As we wrap up the interview by the pool and as the group&nbsp;prepares to get ready for a night of DJ sets and sweat, I ask them if they have any words of advice for struggling artists.</p>
<p>“USE FL STUDIO!” Oshi yells. “I don’t know why I shouted that.”</p>
<p>“Come on, we can give good advice,” Medasin says.</p>
<p>“Actual good advice? To up and comers?” Deffie asks.</p>
<p>“Keep going, dude,” Taja says.</p>
<p><a href="images/6_0.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1305"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1305" src="FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/6_0-300x200.png" alt="6_0" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/6_0-300x200.png 300w, http://heliorecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/6_0.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>“If you’re trying to come up,” Medasin begins, “and actually come up out of the sea of people doing this, don’t clip kicks.”</p>
<p>“That’s Oshi,” Taja laughs.</p>
<p>“That’s me!” Oshi says.</p>
<p>“He does it with swag,” Medasin assures. “He swagger clips.”</p>
<p>“He clips, but with swag.” Deffie jokes. “Learn how to mix first. Period.”</p>
<p>“Pay a lot of attention to the mix,” Medasin agrees. “That’s what separates the fucking boys from the men.”</p>
<p>“I think they need more moral support than technical support,” Oshi suggests. “My moral advice? Don’t try to cater to what people want to hear. Make what you want to hear and people will fuck with it.”</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="./FOUR TALENTS AT THE MANSION_ A POOLSIDE INTERVIEW – Helio Records_files/player(3).html"></iframe>
<p>“I would say,” Deffie continues, “use the people that are close to you to get a step up, to start to get a step up, because if you connect with people that are around you and at similar levels and you come up together, then you gain connections through them over time and it’s a network that develops itself. Plant your seeds far and wide.”</p>
<p>I ask them if they have any final words or thoughts to close with.</p>
<p>“Shouts out my mom,” Taja begins, adding a shout out to&nbsp;“all the weed farmers and the tobacco farms.”</p>
<p>“Shouts out Josh Pan,” Medasin says. “Shouts out flat earth.” He jokes about the globe, about the oblate spheroid, proceeding to shout out Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>“How many shouts do we get?” Deffie asks. I tell him my phone is recording everything, so he can shout out as many people and things that he wants.</p>
<p>“We can shout out everyone we fucking know,” Oshi says. “Shout out my mum, my brothers, my sister, not my dad. I always have to shout out xvideos. Shout out to xvideos.”</p>
<p>“You need that sponsorship,” Deffie says.</p>
<p>“Brazzers, that’s some real shit,” Medasin adds.</p>
<p>“Brazzers is the best,” Deffie agrees.</p>
<p>“Brazzers is the best,” Taja repeats.</p>
<p>“It’s like the Flume of porn,” Medasin adds.</p>
<p>“My parents as well, on top of it all,” Deffie says, shouting out porn and closing with family, a fitting finale to this poolside conversation.</p>
